Summary of Research Activities
======
I am interested in how the genome encodes temporal dynamics in gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner. To answer these questions, I develop and apply quantitative and systems biology methods with the ultimate goal of understanding the data, making useful predictions, and designing novel experiments.

In my PhD, I have focused on the mammalian circadian system as a model to study this question.

[](I develop and apply methods in computational biology to understand regulation of gene expression across regulatory layers, from chromatin conformation, to transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. I have worked closely with experimentalists to make models to understand functional genomics data as well as used these models to make predictions and design new experiments.)
